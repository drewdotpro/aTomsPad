				<h1>The Rules of The Pad</h1>
			</div>
			<div id='list'>
				<ol>
					<li>All rules can and will be overruled at MC Milnwee's and/or DJ Gray's discretion.</li>
					<li>Bring your own beer.</li>
					<li>If in doubt; tequila.<small>This one courtesy of <a href='https://www.facebook.com/cherie.ohara'>Cherie</a>, obviously.</small></li>
					<li>If Nick gets a Flex-On&trade;, don't stare - it just makes it bigger.</li>
					<li>See Alchmoo taking place? DO. NOT. INTERRUPT.</li>
					<li>Everyone sits down to pee - in this palace, we are all equal.</li>
					<li>No throwing bottle caps or bottle foil, or bottles. In fact, anything to do with bottles is right out. You're not 12, and shut up.</li>
					<li>Any invites must be cleared by DJ Gray and MC Milnwee first.</li>
					<li>No.</li>
                                        <li>Please refrain with messing from Neil Hamstrong.</li>
					<li>If someone catches you masturbating, you are legally required to lock eyes with them and finish.</li>
					<li>No one may speak during a Studio Ghibli marathon.</li>
					<li>If you're the last one out, turn the lights off - seriously, there's 2 different switches you can choose from, it's not hard.</li>
					<li>During a Democratic Playlist Situation, anyone may queue up to three songs at a time. No more.</li>
<li>If you receive a call from the commissioner, immediately don the nearest item of spandex and answer the call. <small>Thanks, <a href='https://www.facebook.com/ashley.wilde.58'>Ash</a></small></li>
